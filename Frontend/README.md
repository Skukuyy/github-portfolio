# Portfolio Showcase

Hi! I am a Frontend Developer and currently studying a Software Development degree. My specialization is in website development and I work primarily with React and Javascript.


## Purpose of this Portfolio

Over time I'll be showcasing my projects, ideas, accomplishments in a structured and organized manner. Whether it's large scale project or a small one.
